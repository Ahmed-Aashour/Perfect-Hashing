o(n^2) implementation:

the size of the hashtable is read from the user; the size gets squared and the smallest number power of 2 that covers the desired dictionary size is found to represent the table size. the hashtable is filled intially with Integer.MIN_VALUE, and it is assumed that it won't be inserted. the hashing function is represented by a matrix of 0s and 1s, and it is generated randomly using the setMatrix method. on every collision the rehash method gets called and the hash function is changed, and the function loops througth the table and hashes every entry using the new hash function.
